Jonah:
Created branch "test_home_page" to create my code, however forgot to pull from main before making it so I will probably have to make another one. 
I saved my work to my computer so should just be as quick as a copy paste. 
For some reason I cannot switch to Colins PR branch to add mine so it wont have conflicts. 
Code is done, no extreme difficulties just annoyances with git. Plan for days before the deadline is to get my PR up and reviewed.

Max:
- impl_register_frontend_tests
- Done, no issues, waiting PR approval
- Get all branches merged

Colin:
1. frontend-login-testing
2. complete, all tests are written. 
3. difficulties formatting expected output. 
4. review and update code based on requested changes.

Victor:
1: create-exit-welcome-page-frontend-test
2: Finished writing all test cases however need to reformat expected output file
3:The whitespace is slightly off if copy pasting the expected output from the terminal so Ill need to edit to match the whitespace
4:Fix inconsistent white space in expected output files and create pr to merge tests
